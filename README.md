# Have you ever wanted vertical slabs, or more readable F3 menu in the game?

This modpack has around _85 mods, resourcepacks and shaders_ to make your game **BETTER**.

For example, **Sodium** boost your FPS **to the moon!** Also there is **Axiom** which can help you with building in creative mode! **Better Selection** improves in-game text selection, **Bridging Mod** _(may be against rules on some servers, idk if it even works in multiplayer)_ helps with fast bridging, **Cherished Worlds** pins your favourite mods to the top of world select and prevents it from being deleted... **AND MORE!**

## Just a little bit of gameplay changing

The only one mod ~~(yet)~~ that changes gameplay here is **Serene Seasons**, it adds seasons to the game!

## Discord RPC!

The modpack has CraftPresence mod, which is a mod for Discord Rich Presence, so everyone in Discord can see what are you doing in Minecraft _(use offline mode if you don't want everyone to see it)_
